# AI Contract

This repo is managed by AI Rail.

Model 1 normal workflow:

```text
Create GitHub issue -> rail next --copy -> paste prompt into Codex/Claude/Cursor/Aider -> agent edits only issue scope -> rail verify --copy -> AI reviewer audit -> rail ship
```

An AI reviewer such as ChatGPT, Claude, or another LLM is the planner/reviewer/workflow controller. The coding agent edits locally and stays scoped to the active issue.

Planning flow: `rail plan --copy` before scoped issues exist, then `rail next --copy` one issue at a time. Phase audit flow: after several shipped issues, run `rail phase --copy`; the AI reviewer audits roadmap progress and creates or recommends only right-sized next issues.

`.rail/PROJECT.md` is the full local project memory and roadmap brain. The GitHub roadmap issue is the remote roadmap mirror. GitHub implementation issues are only the active execution queue. Use `rail import` after planning or phase audit.

Rules:

1. Work only on the active GitHub issue or explicitly requested task.
2. Do not create root task folders.
3. Do not create root `ROADMAP.md`.
4. Keep roadmap/current direction in the roadmap issue, then import it into `.rail/PROJECT.md`.
5. Short terminal commands go in chat.
6. Long commands go in downloadable `.txt` or `.md` files.
7. AI-direct GitHub changes must always include local fetch/pull commands.
8. Every response ends with exact next terminal commands.
9. Coding agents do not commit, close issues, or run broad/full test suites unless the issue explicitly asks for them.
10. Coding agents run only focused checks related to the issue, or the exact checks requested by the user or AI Rail.
11. Do not read or modify `.rail/rail.py`, `.rail/state/`, or `Makefile` unless the issue is specifically about AI Rail/tooling.
12. Stop and explain if the task requires broader architecture or extra files.
13. Coding agents do not silently update the roadmap or create extra tasks unless the planning or phase prompt asks.

Model 2 patch workflow: create or choose issue -> ask an AI reviewer for a surgical patch -> apply patch locally -> `rail verify --copy` -> AI reviewer audit -> `rail ship`.

Model 3 AI-direct workflow is for low-risk docs/config/static changes unless risk is explicitly accepted. AI must state Model 3, change only requested GitHub files, provide `git fetch origin`, `git pull --ff-only`, and `git status`, and tell the user to run `rail verify --copy` after pulling.
